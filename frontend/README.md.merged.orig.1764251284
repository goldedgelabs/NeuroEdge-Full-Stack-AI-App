NeuroEdge Frontend - Rebuilt

This is a rebuilt Next.js App Router based frontend scaffold for NeuroEdge.

Features included:
- App Router + TypeScript
- NeuroEdge client provider with TS/PY/GO backend clients
- WebSocket hooks for metrics and recommendations
- API proxy routes to backends
- Simple auth token helpers
- Docker Compose for local full-stack testing (placeholders for backend images)

Next steps:
- Replace backend image placeholders with your built backend images
- Run `npm install` and `npm run dev` to start
- Configure environment variables (TS_BACKEND_URL, PY_BACKEND_URL, GO_BACKEND_URL)

## Next steps completed:
- Added ws reconnection & heartbeat in sdk/wsMultiplexer.ts
- Added Tailwind base setup
- Added integration smoke test at tests/smoke.js
- Added basic auth stubs for TS and Go backends if present

Run `npm ci` and `npm run dev` then `node tests/smoke.js` to validate.
